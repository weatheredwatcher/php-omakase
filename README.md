## This is a collection of scripts, with the intention of automating the setup of my PHP environment on Linux and WSL.

The main crux is installation on Ubuntu 23 either a fresh install of Linux or WSL.

This is also a terminal only process.  We will not be initially installing any GUI applications at all.

This will install the following software/versions


### Software

* Apache
* PHP
* MariaDB
* Git
* Docker
* Composer
* Neovim
* ZSH
* TMUX

Will also include my vim setup for PHP, my TMUX setup, and Oh-My-ZSH
